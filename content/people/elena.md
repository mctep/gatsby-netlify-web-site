### What do you do at Genestack?

I develop web interfaces for our apps. Genestack Frontend team uses up-to-date libraries and tools and cares greatly about the quality of our product. I work with specialists in UX, and also have an opportunity to learn a lot of new things related to biology, genetics and data management.

### What is your background?

I studied Mathematics and Statistics at university and went on to work as a data analyst and a business analyst in a big company. After that, I worked as a frontend developer for several years because I found that engineering is the most fitting way for me to impact the world.

Gradually, I became more and more fascinated with the idea of improving the human-computer interaction. Users should feel happy about the software you develop for them. They use it for their job and they should feel confident interacting with your app. And I believe it contributes to the progress of humanity. 

What do you like most about your job?
I love the perfect balance of autonomy and working in collaboration with smart, creative and result-oriented people at Genestack.
The environment here encourages me to continuously develop my professional skills and grow my competence.
