**Cambridge, UK, May 2020** — Genestack Ltd. today announced that its flagship multi-omics data catalogue, curation and integrative search product, **Omics Data Manager (ODM)**, has been licensed and implemented by **AstraZeneca**.

Genestack’s ODM is an enabling technology providing a central hub for organising and querying **multi-omics** data from multiple sites, including transcriptomics and proteomics. Curation tools, such as ODM, will enable AstraZeneca scientists to ensure the metadata for studies, samples and data files is accurate, complete and consistent with their data model. ODM’s flexible APIs will integrate into AstraZeneca’s existing IT architecture and allow cross-study and cross-omics queries. The tool will allow AstraZeneca to **fully utilise past, present and future omics datasets** by making data findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable (FAIR).

"ODM is our latest product and it builds on years of close work between our domain experts and those at global biopharmaceutical companies. We’re proud of the modern technology stack, flexible multi-omics data and metadata models and APIs, as well as our focus on great user experience. We believe firmly that modern enterprise data strategy is not just about software, but also about the right team and an agile, collaborative, long-term approach." — Misha Kapushesky, CEO Genestack Limited.

"Our collaboration with Genestack helps build a single data platform for many of our scientists to query omics data from a large number of studies across R&D. Omics Data Manager will allow our scientists and bioinformaticians to fully harness omics data for faster and more relevant drug discovery and translational research." — Claus Bendtsen, Executive Director Data Sciences & Quantitative Biology, Discovery Sciences, R&D, AstraZeneca.
