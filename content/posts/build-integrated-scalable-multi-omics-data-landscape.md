_Watch our presentation from **Bio-IT World 2020, with Kevin Dialdestoro, Head of Data Science Consulting at Genestack**._

**Omics data** has now become a key success ingredient, for **target identification** in research, to patient selection **in clinical trials**. However, we spend far too much time harmonizing and integrating data, rather than applying them. This is because of data silos, incompatible data and metadata, and scalability issues. So organizations are now striving for a more scalable and FAIR data landscape.

In this talk, Kevin Dialdestoro, Head of Data Science Consulting at Genestack, explains how to build a more integrated and scalable Omics Data Landscape, as we embrace the use of multi-omics data across research and clinical trials.

During the talk you will learn:

How your organization will benefit from integrated omics data
Why some initiatives fail & others succeed
How our solution and collaborative process help organisations move from fragmented systems to a FAIR data landscape
